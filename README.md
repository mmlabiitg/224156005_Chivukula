This is my Masters Thesis work with Multimedia Lab at IIT Guwahati.

– Enhanced underwater images through the integration of transformer-based architectures.
– Employed PCA based image fusion to create river water images from existing underwater image datasets.
– Developed a novel Depth-guided Image Enhancement transformer architecture. Performed better than SOTA
architectures on PSNR and SSIM metrics.
